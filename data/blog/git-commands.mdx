A high level overview of git functionality, all in one place.
**Bold** is definition, `inline code` is terminal command related.

## Terminology

General terms

- **Working Directory** is your current folder/directory
- **Staging Area** shows files that will be in the next commit (or not)
- **Commit** a 'save point' in your version control you can always go back to

Terminal... terms

- `git` a version control system used in software development
- `HEAD` is the most recent commit
- `origin` is the codebase to 'trust' the most (remote, probably on Github)
- `remote` references your remote repository (probably Github)
- `branch` is the current working branch of the git tree

## Getting Started

Initialize a new local repository, stage your files, and start committing them

- `git init` initializes a new local git repository in the current working directory
- `git add filename` adds file to the staging area
- `git reset` removes all files from staging area
- `git commit -m 'commit message'` new commit, use syntax "This commit will..." for msg

## Branches

Work more effectively with coworkers by creating a branch before making changes to a shared repository. This tracks changes under a 'branch' that can then be merged with the main via a pull request

- `git branch new branch_name` create a new git branch
- `git branch -d branch_name` safely deletes branch assuming merged

- `git checkout branch_name` moves to `branch_name` branch
- `git checkout -b branch_name` does both of the above, combined
- `git checkout -` takes you to last branch you were working on

- `git rebase main` to move your branch's history up to main's `HEAD`
- `git rebase main --interactive` to select which commits to `squash` replaces `pick`
- `git merge branch_name` to merge branch you're ON (`main`?) with `branch_name`

## Getting Information

- `git status` checks current status of staging area
- `git diff` shows difference between
- `git log` shows log of project's commits use `--graph --oneline` to simplify
- `git remote -v` shows current remote repository connection

## Working with Github

- `git remote add origin ssh address` connect initialized local repo to a Github repository
- `git clone ssh address` creates a new project folder locally with git init'd to remote
- `git push -u origin branch_name` push last commit to remote, all future pushes can use
- `git push` push to remote once set up with above
- `git pull` pull down latest changes from Github repository

## Fixing Things

Fix your messed up commit messages or files forgotten from last commit

- `git commit --amend` opens text editor to modify last commit message
- `git commit --amend -m 'commit_message'` updates most recent commit to `commit_message`
- `git add file` then `git commit --amend --no-edit` adds forgotten file to last commit
- `git reset commit_id` leaves files 'as-is' but un-commits last commit
- `git reset --hard commit_id` deletes last commit and all changes since

## Stashing Things

When you are writing code but doesn't work yet, and you want to save for later without committing your work to the official history

- `git stash` saves your changes since last commit for later in an array
- `git stash pop` brings back your most recent `stash` from end of array
- `git stash save name` save a stash with a specific name
- `git stash list` list all available stashes by name
- `git stash apply index_num` brings back stash at index position `index_num`

## Advanced Git

You can do custom key bindings using aliases
